I am a postdoc at California State University Fullerton (CSUF). My research is focused on enhancing our ability to understand the universe through gravitational-wave astronomy, specifically through improving gravitational-wave detectors and the models we use to interpret gravitational-wave signals.

Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime, which originate as a consequence of the accelerations of massive objects. As gravitational waves propagate outward from their source, they stretch and squeeze the distance between objects by an amount proportional to the original distance between them. Masses and gravitation near Earth are not nearly great enough to produce detectable gravitational waves, but cataclysmic interactions of massive objects far out in the universe — such as colliding black holes — make such a splash in spacetime that the resulting ripples can be detected on Earth with extremely precise instruments.

A century after Einstein predicted the existence of gravitational waves, through the efforts of hundreds of scientists and engineers pushing the frontiers of technology over several decades, the two Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) detectors opened a new window on the universe by discovering gravitational waves passing through Earth emanating from the merger of two black holes. The phenomenal precision that LIGO needs to measure these faint waves (one thousandth of the diameter of a proton!) requires exquisitely isolated detectors. Capturing the physics of the colliding black holes and neutron stars requires accurate waveform models. My research addresses both of these challenges, which are crucial for progressing from the first discoveries to an era of gravitational-wave astronomy.
