Education
======
* Ph.D in Physics, Louisiana State University, 2017 
Thesis title: The effects of instrumental noise on searches for generic transient gravitational waves in Advanced LIGO
* B.S. in Physics, Abilene Chrisian University, 2010

Research experience
======
* Postdoctoral Research, California State University, Fullerton, 2017 - Present
  My two main research focuses are characterizing of the instrumentation of gravitational-wave observatories to increase their astronomical reach and improving  theoretical gravitational waveform models using numerical relativity.
  * Collaborated with professors and students to develop a linear regression algorithm to find correlations between LIGO's range and instrumental noise, and led a paper describing the methods, accepted for publication in Classical and Quantum Gravity https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.02592
  * Led efforts in the LIGO detector characterization group to coordinate instrumental characterization and validation of candidate gravitational-wave signals
  * Performed numerical relativity simulations needed to extend binary black hole waveform models to higher mass ratios and higher spins}
  * Developed reduced order models to create accurate waveforms for high spin black hole mergers
